When making changes to tables (or creating new tables), edit the schema.prisma file.
Then, run the `npx prisma migrate dev --name [name_of_operation (ie add_login_history)]`
Then, run `npx prisma generate`
Might have to restart TS server for the changes to take effect in VS code (ie. autocomplete new table names)
